# Vim
I used [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) as a plugin manager. 

### Plugins 

* [vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline)
* [vim-colorschemes](https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes): for specific colorschemes you'll need a 256 bit colored terminal, like the gnome-terminal.
* [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
* indentLine, displaying indentation blocks more clearly.
* ultisnips/vim-snippets, a wide range of snippets for different programming languages.
* delimitMate, for automatically inserting closing brackets.

### Fonts

* [powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
