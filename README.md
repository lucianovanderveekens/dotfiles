# Vimrc
This repository has only one purpose, to share a vim terminal configuration between multiple machines and perhaps to serve as an example config for others. This repo represents my ~/.vim directory together with the config file.

I used [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) as a plugin manager. 

### Plugins 

* [vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline)
* [vim-colorschemes](https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes): for specific colorschemes you'll need a 256 bit colored terminal, like the gnome-terminal.
* [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)

### Fonts

* [powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
