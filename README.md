# Vim
I used [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) as a plugin manager. 

### Plugins 

* [vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline)
* [vim-colorschemes](https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes): for specific colorschemes you'll need a 256 bit colored terminal, like the gnome-terminal.
* [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
* [indentLine](https://github.com/Yggdroot/indentLine), displaying indentation blocks more clearly.
* [vim-snippets](https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets), a wide range of snippets for different programming languages.
* [relimitMate](https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate), for automatically inserting closing brackets.
* [matchit](https://github.com/tmhedberg/matchit), to jump between opening and closing attributes (xml).

### Fonts

* [powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
